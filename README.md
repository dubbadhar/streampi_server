# StreamPi Server

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ladiesman6969/streampi_server/master/app_icon.png)

This repository has the source code for StreamPi Server, which runs on the Computer, to communicate and talk to [StreamPi Client](https://github.com/ladiesman6969/streampi_client)

#### What is StreamPi?

StreamPi is an opensource, free alternative to the [Elgato Stream Deck](https://www.elgato.com/en/gaming/stream-deck), which is a fully customizable and powerful multi-purpose keyboard. 

#### Why StreamPi?

The original Stream Deck can serve as an extremely useful and powerful tool for Streamers, gamers, and professional users. However, it is not a budget friendly option for the average user. Hence, we decided to work on an opensource and cheaper alternative to the Stream Deck - The StreamPi

#### How to use StreamPi?

You can browse through a comprehensive list of tutorials [here](google.com).

**ON LINUX SYSTEMS, THE MINIMUM PORT MUST BE 1024, OR ELSE SERVER MUST BE RUN AS ROOT**

StreamPi has two branches of software - [Server](https://github.com/ladiesman6969/streampi_server) and [Client](https://github.com/ladiesman6969/streampi_client)

This repository contains the Server Side code, which can run on any desktop/laptop running Windows or Linux. 

The [client](https://github.com/ladiesman6969/streampi_client/) was originally written for the [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/), which is a very cheap and powerful Single Board Computer. However, since this is written completely in Java, it can run virtually anywhere, even on another PC!

TL:DR you can run StreamPi Server, and Client on Linux, Windows and MacOS!

Since the Raspberry Pi is a small form factor motherboard, it can be used as a keyboard, if paired with any touch screen.

#### How to install StreamPi Server?

Configuring Server is pretty easy, grab the latest build from [Releases](https://github.com/ladiesman6969/streampi_server/releases) according to your preferred Operating System, and then run the server.bat (Windows), server.sh (Linux and MacOS) to start the Server! No Installation required!

#### Requirements

* A network connection to connect to the Client, via a router, or LAN.

* This software has been written with Java, and is designed to work with Java 11+. If you want to compile this on your own, then you need to have Java 11+ installed on your computer, along with JavaFX 11+ installed. [BellSoft's Liberica JDK 11](https://bell-sw.com/pages/java-11.0.4/) is preferred as it comes pre-bundled JavaFX 11.
